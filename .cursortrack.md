# Bump Project Tracking

## Project Overview
"Bump" fosters spontaneous in-person connections by helping users share and discover favorite gathering spots, track real-time statuses, and log meetups, blending serendipity with subtle intent, inspired by Boulder's social vibe.

## Current State

   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Status: **Not Started**

## Next Steps
1. Set up Supabase project
2. Create database schema
3. Implement authentication with Supabase
4. Set up real-time subscriptions with polling fallback
5. Connect the auth context to Supabase

## Completed Steps
- Created project tracking file (.cursortrack.md)
- Initialized Vite project with React and TypeScript template
- Installed core dependencies (react, react-dom, react-router-dom, styled-components, etc.)
- Installed development dependencies (vitest, testing-library, etc.)
- Initialized Supabase project locally
- Created environment files (.env.development and .env.test)
- Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode and path aliases
- Created theme system with TypeScript interfaces
- Implemented global styles
- Set up React Router with all required routes
- Created authentication context with placeholder functions
- Implemented UI components (Button, Card, Input, BottomNavigation)
- Created page components (Auth, Home, Places, Friends, Meetups, Settings)
- Set up PWA configuration with service worker registration
- Fixed build errors and ensured successful build

## Notes on Supabase Initialization
When initializing Supabase with `supabase init`, you may be prompted about generating VS Code settings for Deno. You can bypass this by using `echo "N" | supabase init` to automatically answer "no" to this question.

If you encounter port conflicts when starting Supabase, you may need to stop other Supabase projects first:
```bash
supabase stop --project-id <conflicting-project-id>
supabase start
```
