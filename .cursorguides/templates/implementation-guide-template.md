## Test-First Approach

Before implementing each component or feature in this milestone, create tests that define the expected behavior:

1. **Define Test Cases**: Outline the test cases for each component/feature
2. **Write Test Files**: Create test files with failing tests
3. **Implement Features**: Develop the features until tests pass
4. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring tests continue to pass

> ðŸ“Œ **Critical Context:** Follow the [Testing Strategy](../concepts/testing-strategy.md) and use the [Test Template](../templates/test-template.md) to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
