## Test-First Approach

Before implementing each feature in this milestone, create tests that define the expected behavior:

1. **Define Test Cases**: Outline the test cases for each Supabase integration feature
2. **Create Mock Implementations**: Set up mock Supabase clients for testing
3. **Write Test Files**: Create test files with failing tests
4. **Implement Features**: Develop the features until tests pass
5. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring tests continue to pass

> ðŸ“Œ **Critical Context:** Follow the [Supabase Testing](../troubleshooting/supabase-testing.md) guide for setting up proper test environments and mocks.

## Requirements

### 1. Supabase Project Setup

> ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review the [Supabase Integration Template](../templates/supabase-integration-template.md) for project setup patterns.

**Objective**: Create and configure a Supabase project for the Bump application.

**Requirements**:
- Create a new Supabase project in the dashboard
- Configure local development environment with Supabase CLI
- Set up environment variables for local and production environments
- Test connection to both local and production Supabase instances

**Configuration Needs**:
- Environment variables for URLs and API keys
- Separate configurations for development and testing
- Connection fallback strategies

**Test Approach**:
- Create tests that verify connection to Supabase
- Test environment variable loading
- Verify that the client can be initialized correctly

**Example Environment Structure**:
```
# .env.development
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<local_or_prod_url>
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon_key>
```

### 2. Database Schema Implementation

> ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** Consult the [Supabase Integration Template](../templates/supabase-integration-template.md) for schema design patterns.

**Objective**: Create the database tables and relationships according to the schema specifications.

**Requirements**:
- Implement all tables specified in the DB Schema section
- Set up proper foreign key relationships with CASCADE rules
- Configure RLS (Row Level Security) policies for data access control
- Create necessary indexes for performance optimization
- Implement enum types for status fields like `hope_to_bump` and `notify_for`

**Tables to Implement**:
- `profiles` - User profile information (extends auth.users)
- `auth_otp` - OTP codes for email verification
- `places` - Gathering locations information
- `user_places` - Links users to their preferred places
- `statuses` - User check-ins with activity information
- `meetups` - Logged encounters between users
- `friends` - Friend connections with intent data
- `settings` - User preferences and configurations
- `notifications` - In-app notification storage

**Test Approach**:
- Create tests that verify table creation
- Test foreign key constraints
- Verify that RLS policies work as expected
- Test enum type validation

**Example RLS Policy Pattern**:
```sql
-- Example pattern for RLS policy (implement for each table)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profiles"
ON profiles FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

### 3. Supabase Client Setup

**Example Client Pattern**:
```typescript
// Example type definition pattern (not complete)
export type Tables = {
  profiles: {
    Row: {
      id: string;
      email: string;
      phone: string | null;
      username: string;
      created_at: string;
    };
    Insert: {
      // Define insert type
    };
    Update: {
      // Define update type
    };
  };
  // Define other tables...
};
```

### 4. Authentication Implementation

> ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review the [Authentication Flow](../concepts/authentication-flow.md) and [Authentication Issues](../troubleshooting/authentication-issues.md) guides.

2. **Security**:
   - Apply RLS policies to all tables
   - Validate all user inputs before database operations
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implement proper authentication checks
   - Follow least privilege principle for database access

3. **Performance**:
   - Optimize query patterns to minimize database load
   - Implement proper indexes for frequently queried columns
   - Use connection pooling for efficient resource usage
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Monitor and optimize query performance

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - Implement proper foreign key constraints
   - Use transactions for operations that modify multiple tables
   - Validate data before insertion or update
   - Implement proper cascade rules for deletions
   - Handle edge cases like duplicate entries
