### Tool-Specific Patterns
- **Vite**: 
  - Configure aliases in both vite.config.ts and tsconfig.json
  - Set up Vitest with the same configuration as Vite
  - Use `vite-plugin-pwa` for PWA configuration
  
- **React Router**: 
  - Use `createBrowserRouter` for type-safe routes
  - Implement lazy loading for route components
  - Set up route guards for authentication

- **Styled Components**:
  - Use transient props (`$propName`) to prevent props from being passed to the DOM
  - Create a theme declaration file for TypeScript integration
  - Use the `css` helper for complex style blocks

## Test-First Approach

Before implementing each component or feature in this milestone, create tests that define the expected behavior:

1. **Define Test Cases**: Outline the test cases for each component/feature
2. **Write Test Files**: Create test files with failing tests
3. **Implement Features**: Develop the features until tests pass
4. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring tests continue to pass

> ğŸ“Œ **Critical Context:** Follow the [Testing Strategy](../concepts/testing-strategy.md) and use the [Test Template](../templates/test-template.md) to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## Requirements

### 1. TypeScript Configuration

> ğŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review the [Project Structure Template](../templates/project-structure-template.md) for TypeScript configuration patterns.

**Objective**: Configure TypeScript with strict type checking to ensure type safety throughout the project.

**Requirements**:
- Use ES2022+ target
- Enable strict mode with all strict flags
- Configure path aliases for clean imports (e.g., `@/components/*` for `src/components/*`)
- Include DOM and DOM.Iterable libraries
- Set up proper module resolution

**Key Settings to Include**:
- `strict: true`
- `noImplicitAny: true`
- `strictNullChecks: true`
- Path aliases for src directory
- Proper JSX handling for React

**Test Approach**:
- Create a simple TypeScript file that uses various language features
- Verify that imports with aliases work correctly
- Ensure strict type checking catches errors

### 2. Theme System

> ğŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review the [Styled Components Best Practices](../concepts/styled-components-best-practices.md) for theme implementation patterns.

**Objective**: Create a strongly-typed theme system that enforces the style guide specifications.

**Requirements**:
- Define TypeScript interfaces for all theme properties
- Implement the theme according to the style guide in section 3
- Integrate with styled-components
- Create type declarations for styled-components to use the theme
- Set up global styles using the theme

**Theme Properties to Include**:
- Colors: primary (#2E7D32), primaryLight (#E8F5E9), background (#D7CCC8), etc.
- Typography: Roboto font, sizes (16px body, 20px h1, 14px small)
- Spacing scale: [0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64]
- Border radii: sm (4px), md (8px), lg (12px)
- Animations: pulse and fade with specified durations

**Test Approach**:
- Create tests that validate theme values against specifications
- Test that theme is properly applied to styled components
- Verify that TypeScript catches invalid theme usage

**Example Pattern** (theme interface - not complete):
```typescript
export interface Theme {
  colors: {
    primary: string;
    primaryLight: string;
    // Add other colors...
  };
  // Add other theme sections...
}
```

### 3. App Routing

> ğŸ“Œ **Reference:** Consult the [Component Template](../templates/component-template.md) for layout component patterns.

**Objective**: Set up the application's routing structure using React Router.

**Requirements**:
- Use React Router v6+
- Define routes for all pages: Auth, Home, Places, Friends, Meetups, Settings
- Implement a default redirect from root to Home
- Hide the navigation bar on the Auth page
- Wrap the router with the theme provider

**Route Structure**:
- `/auth` - Authentication flow
- `/home` - Home page with friend statuses
- `/places` - Gathering places page
- `/friends` - Friends management
- `/meetups` - Meetup logging and history
- `/settings` - User preferences

**Test Approach**:
- Test that routes render the correct components
- Verify that navigation between routes works
- Test that the navigation bar is hidden on the Auth page

### 4. Authentication Context

> ğŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review the [Authentication Flow](../concepts/authentication-flow.md) for auth context patterns.

**Objective**: Create a context to manage user authentication state throughout the app.

**Requirements**:
- Create AuthContext and AuthProvider
- Track authentication state (loading, authenticated, user data)
- Implement authentication methods (login, logout, etc.)
- Add typescript types for auth state and methods
- Prepare for OTP authentication flow

**Authentication State to Track**:
- User ID and profile data
- Authentication status
- Loading states

**Test Approach**:
- Test that the context provides the correct initial state
- Verify that authentication methods update the state correctly
- Test that components can consume the context

**Example Pattern** (auth context structure):
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  user: UserProfile | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  login: (email: string) => Promise<void>;
  verifyOtp: (email: string, otp: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

### 5. Bottom Navigation

> ğŸ“Œ **Reference:** Use the [Component Template](../templates/component-template.md) for component structure.

**Objective**: Implement a bottom navigation bar for mobile-first navigation.

**Requirements**:
- Create a fixed-position navigation bar at the bottom of the screen
- Include icons and labels for all main sections
- Highlight the active route
- Hide on the auth page
- Match the design specifications (height: 48px, evenly spaced)

**Navigation Items**:
- Home
- Places
- Friends
- Meetups
- Settings

**Test Approach**:
- Test that the navigation bar renders all items
- Verify that the active route is highlighted
- Test that the navigation bar is hidden on the Auth page
- Test navigation functionality

### 6. Common UI Components

> ğŸ“Œ **Reference:** Follow the [Component Template](../templates/component-template.md) and [Styled Components Best Practices](../concepts/styled-components-best-practices.md).

**Objective**: Create reusable UI components that will be used throughout the application.

**Requirements**:
- Implement Button component with variants (primary, secondary, text)
- Create Card component for content containers
- Build Form components (inputs, selects, checkboxes)
- Ensure all components are accessible and responsive
- Use the theme for consistent styling
- Add thorough TypeScript types for props

**Component Patterns**:
- Use styled-components for styling
- Accept common props like className for composition
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Handle loading and disabled states where appropriate

**Test Approach**:
- Test rendering of components with different props
- Verify that variants apply the correct styles
- Test interaction behaviors (click, focus, etc.)
- Test accessibility features

### 7. Page Component Templates

> ğŸ“Œ **Reference:** Use the [Component Template](../templates/component-template.md) for page structure.

**Objective**: Create baseline templates for each page component.

**Requirements**:
- Create minimal implementations of all page components:
  - Auth
  - Home
  - Places
  - Friends
  - Meetups
  - Settings
- Each page should have a consistent layout structure
- Add page-specific TypeScript interfaces
- Prepare for data fetching patterns
- Design for max-width 600px on desktop with centered content

**Test Approach**:
- Test that each page component renders correctly
- Verify that the layout structure is consistent
- Test responsive behavior

### 8. Testing Setup

> ğŸ“Œ **Reference:** Follow the [Testing Strategy](../concepts/testing-strategy.md) and [Test Template](../templates/test-template.md).

**Objective**: Configure the testing environment and create initial tests.

**Requirements**:
- Set up Vitest with jsdom for component testing
- Configure testing-library for React
- Create test utilities for common testing patterns
- Write basic tests for theme and UI components
- Ensure tests run correctly with `npm test`

**Test Coverage**:
- Theme validation
- Component rendering
- Basic interactions

**Example Pattern** (component test structure):
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import theme from '../styles/theme';
import Button from './Button';

// Example test structure - implement with actual component
test('renders button with text', () => {
  render(
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
  
  expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### 9. PWA Configuration

> ğŸ“Œ **Reference:** Consult the [Performance Optimization](../troubleshooting/performance-optimization.md) guide for PWA best practices.

**Objective**: Set up Progressive Web App capabilities.

**Requirements**:
- Configure Vite PWA plugin
- Set up service worker registration
- Create app manifest with proper icons and theme colors
- Implement offline fallback
- Ensure proper caching strategies

**Test Approach**:
- Verify that the service worker registers correctly
- Test that the app works offline
- Check that the manifest is properly generated

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

These patterns should be applied consistently across all components and features in this milestone:

1. **Accessibility**: 
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Include ARIA attributes where needed
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works
   - Maintain sufficient color contrast
   - Test with screen readers

2. **Performance**:
   - Implement code splitting for routes
   - Use React.memo for expensive components
   - Optimize styled-components with proper composition
   - Minimize unnecessary re-renders

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error boundaries for component errors
   - Add proper error states to components
   - Use try/catch for async operations
   - Provide user-friendly error messages

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Follow mobile-first approach
   - Test on multiple screen sizes
   - Use relative units (rem, %) instead of fixed pixels
   - Implement proper breakpoints
