## Test-First Approach

Before implementing each feature in this milestone, create tests that define the expected behavior:

1. **Define Test Cases**: Outline the test cases for the new features
2. **Write Test Files**: Create test files with failing tests
3. **Implement Features**: Develop the features until tests pass
4. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring tests continue to pass

> ðŸ“Œ **Critical Context:** Follow the [Testing Strategy](../concepts/testing-strategy.md) and use the [Test Template](../templates/test-template.md) to ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Add Animations

> ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review [Styled Components Best Practices](../concepts/styled-components-best-practices.md) for animation patterns.

**Objective**: Add animations to enhance the user experience.

**Requirements**:
- Implement pulse animations for interactive elements
- Add fade animations for modals and transitions
- Ensure animations are subtle and enhance rather than distract from the user experience
- Make animations accessible (respect reduced motion preferences)

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create a new file `src/styles/animations.ts` for reusable animations
2. Implement the following animations:
   - Pulse animation for buttons and interactive elements
   - Fade animation for modals and transitions
   - Slide animation for panels and drawers
3. Add animations to key components:
   - Check-in button on the Home page
   - Modal entries and exits
   - Notification bell when new notifications arrive
   - List item entries and exits
4. Respect the user's reduced motion preferences using the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
5. Test animations on different devices and browsers

**Test Approach**:
- Create unit tests for animation components
- Test that animations respect reduced motion preferences
- Manually test animations on different devices and browsers

### 2. Ensure Responsive UI

> ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review the application's current responsive design.

**Objective**: Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on all device sizes.

**Requirements**:
- Verify that all pages and components are responsive
- Optimize layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile
- Test on various device sizes and orientations

**Implementation Details**:
1. Review all pages and components for responsive design issues
2. Implement responsive improvements:
   - Adjust layouts for different screen sizes
   - Optimize touch targets for mobile
   - Ensure text is readable on all devices
   - Fix any overflow issues
3. Test on various device sizes and orientations:
   - Mobile (portrait and landscape)
   - Tablet (portrait and landscape)
   - Desktop (various window sizes)
4. Implement device-specific optimizations where necessary

**Test Approach**:
- Create responsive tests using testing library's screen size utilities
- Manually test on different devices and browsers
- Use browser developer tools to simulate different device sizes

### 3. Set Up PWA

> ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review the Vite PWA plugin documentation.

**Objective**: Set up Progressive Web App functionality to allow offline access and installation.

**Requirements**:
- Configure the Vite PWA plugin
- Create a manifest file with appropriate icons and metadata
- Implement service worker registration and updates
- Add offline fallback pages
- Test PWA installation and offline functionality

**Implementation Details**:
1. Configure the Vite PWA plugin in `vite.config.ts`
2. Create or update the manifest file with:
   - Application name and description
   - Icons in various sizes
   - Theme colors
   - Display mode (standalone)
3. Implement service worker registration in `src/main.tsx`
4. Create offline fallback pages
5. Add a PWA update notification component
6. Test PWA installation and offline functionality

**Test Approach**:
- Create tests for service worker registration
- Test offline functionality
- Manually test PWA installation on different devices

### 4. Optimize Performance

> ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review [Performance Optimization](../troubleshooting/performance-optimization.md) for optimization techniques.

**Objective**: Optimize the application's performance for a smooth user experience.

**Requirements**:
- Analyze and optimize bundle size
- Implement code splitting for routes
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement performance monitoring
- Ensure fast initial load times

**Implementation Details**:
1. Analyze the bundle size using Vite's build tools
2. Implement code splitting for routes:
   - Use dynamic imports for route components
   - Preload critical routes
3. Optimize images and assets:
   - Compress images
   - Use appropriate image formats
   - Implement lazy loading for images
4. Implement performance monitoring:
   - Add performance metrics collection
   - Monitor key user interactions
5. Optimize initial load time:
   - Minimize critical CSS
   - Defer non-critical JavaScript
   - Implement resource hints (preload, prefetch)

**Test Approach**:
- Measure performance metrics before and after optimizations
- Test load times on different devices and network conditions
- Use Lighthouse or similar tools to assess performance

### 5. Deploy to Vercel

> ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** Review Vercel documentation for deployment best practices.

**Objective**: Deploy the application to Vercel for production use.

**Requirements**:
- Set up a Vercel project
- Configure environment variables
- Set up continuous deployment from the repository
- Configure custom domain (if applicable)
- Implement monitoring and analytics

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create a Vercel account and project
2. Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
   - Supabase URL and API key
   - Google Maps API key
   - Other environment-specific variables
4. Set up build and deployment settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
   - Node.js version: Latest LTS
5. Configure a custom domain (if applicable)
6. Set up monitoring and analytics:
   - Vercel Analytics
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring

**Test Approach**:
- Test the deployed application on various devices and browsers
- Verify that environment variables are correctly configured
- Test critical user flows in the production environment

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

These patterns should be applied consistently across all components and features in this milestone:

1. **Error Handling**: 
   - Implement consistent error handling for all user interactions
   - Add error boundaries to prevent the entire application from crashing
   - Log errors to a monitoring service in production

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use memoization for expensive computations
   - Implement virtualization for long lists
   - Optimize data fetching and caching
   - Minimize re-renders

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure all components are keyboard navigable
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Test with screen readers
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast
   - Respect user preferences (reduced motion, dark mode, etc.)

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Follow mobile-first approach
   - Test on multiple device sizes
   - Ensure all features are usable on mobile devices

## Verification Checklist

Before considering this milestone complete, ensure:

- [ ] All animations are implemented and working correctly

- [ ] PWA functionality is set up and working
- [ ] Performance optimizations are implemented
- [ ] The application is deployed to Vercel
- [ ] All tests are passing in the production environment
- [ ] Manual testing confirms expected behavior
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Animations causing performance issues | Optimize animations to use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity) and reduce complexity. |
| Responsive design issues on specific devices | Test on actual devices or accurate emulators and implement device-specific fixes where necessary. |
| PWA not installing | Verify that the manifest file is correctly configured and that the application is served over HTTPS. |
| Service worker caching issues | Implement proper cache invalidation strategies and version your cache storage. |
| Environment variables not working in production | Verify that environment variables are correctly configured in the Vercel dashboard and that they are accessed correctly in the code. |
| Build failures in Vercel | Check the build logs for errors and ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed. |

## Next Steps
