## Notes on Supabase Initialization
When initializing Supabase with `supabase init`, you may be prompted about generating VS Code settings for Deno. You can bypass this by using `echo "N" | supabase init` to automatically answer "no" to this question.

If you encounter port conflicts when starting Supabase, you may need to stop other Supabase projects first:
```bash
supabase stop --project-id <conflicting-project-id>
supabase start
```

## Learnings & Best Practices
- **Styled Components Transient Props**: Use the `$propName` syntax for props that should be used only for styling and not passed to the DOM. This prevents React DOM warnings about non-standard HTML attributes. For example, use `$fullWidth` instead of `fullWidth` when the prop is only used for styling.

- **Context Management in Implementation Guides**: Each implementation guide should explicitly reference related resources (concepts, templates, troubleshooting guides) to ensure all relevant context is considered during development. This helps prevent missing important patterns or best practices.

- **Test-First Approach**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure clear requirements and better test coverage. This approach helps catch issues early and leads to more maintainable code.

- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Identify patterns that should be applied consistently across components and features (error handling, accessibility, performance, security) and document them in implementation guides. This ensures consistent implementation of these important aspects.

- **Documentation Organization**: Keep all project documentation in a dedicated directory (.cursorguides) for better organization and discoverability.

- **Supabase Integration**: Use a singleton pattern for the Supabase client to ensure consistent configuration across the application. Implement proper error handling and type safety for all Supabase operations.

- **Authentication Flow**: Implement a clean authentication flow with proper error handling and user feedback. Use the Supabase auth state change listener to keep the UI in sync with the authentication state.

- **Testing Supabase**: Mock the Supabase client in tests to avoid making actual API calls. Test both success and error cases for all Supabase operations.

- **Row Level Security**: Implement proper RLS policies to ensure data security at the database level. Test RLS policies to verify they work as expected.

- **Realtime Subscriptions**: Implement polling fallback for environments where WebSocket connections are not supported or are blocked.

- **Test Mocking Best Practices**: When mocking functions that are imported and used by other functions, use `vi.spyOn` on the imported module rather than trying to mock with `require()`. This ensures proper module resolution in the ESM environment.

- **Form Validation**: Implement client-side validation for forms to provide immediate feedback to users. Use separate state variables for different types of errors (e.g., validation errors vs. API errors) to provide more specific feedback.

- **Modal Pattern**: Use a consistent pattern for modals throughout the application. This includes handling opening/closing, backdrop clicks, and ensuring proper accessibility.

- **Testing React Components**: When testing React components, be aware of the limitations of testing libraries. Sometimes it's better to test component behavior (e.g., function calls, state changes) rather than trying to test specific DOM elements that might be difficult to query.

- **Integration Testing with Supabase**: Implement integration tests that make actual API calls to a test database to catch issues that unit tests with mocks might miss, such as incorrect query syntax or mismatched data structures. Use a dedicated test script that creates and cleans up test data to ensure tests are isolated and don't interfere with each other.
